# Outlier AI Training Repository

This repository contains various Python scripts and notes used for experimenting with concepts such as CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), serial communication, and geospatial zone detection.

## Contents

- `csma_pc.py` and `tdd_pc.py` – examples of serial communication implementations in Python.
- `tdd_edge.py` – edge device code for sending and receiving packets.
- `prg-01.py` and `prg-02.py` – utilities for tracking zone transitions using geographic data.
- `introduction_improved.txt` and `response.txt` – text notes that accompany the code.

Most of the code and documentation is written in Thai with comments that outline the intended behaviour of each component.

## Usage

These scripts are intended as references or experiments. To run any of the Python examples, ensure you have the necessary dependencies (such as `pyserial` and `geopandas`) installed:

```bash
pip install pyserial geopandas shapely
```

Run a script with:

```bash
python prg-01.py
```

Adjust the command according to the file you wish to execute.
